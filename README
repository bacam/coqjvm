This repository contains:

  - An executable semantics for a substantial fragment of the JVM in Coq [1];
  - a verifier for simple resource properties where the specifications and
    proofs are embedded in class files, written in Coq;
  - an OCaml library for dealing with JVM classfiles; and
  - a slightly modified copy of extlib 1.5 (see below).

At the time of writing, I was able to build it with OCaml 4.02.1 and a
prerelease version of Coq 8.5, except for the extracted OCaml code which is
suffering from https://coq.inria.fr/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=3923.  (Although the
standalone ILL proof checker works.)

The copy of extlib-1.5 has been modified.  In particular (from the original svn
logs):

  - Properly implement the header=false option in extlib's unzip
  - Fix off-by-one error in extlib's unzip module

and there are some minor changes to the IO module.  Some of the unzip changes
may be in later versions of extlib.
